Hello, I'm Alex or ajpkim. I primarily work on full-stack and data science projects. For myself, I like going down rabbit holes into things like functional programming and emacs. Research-wise, I'm interested in both the philosophical and computational foundations of cognitive science, evolution, and consciousness.

Here's my personal site: https://ajpkim.com/.
